# Activity 2

- Enhancing the "Guessing Game"  using Sockets
- Prof: Sir Roy Dosado
- Student: Ivern Bryant Buala
- BSIT 2 BLOCK 1

## Instructions

1. user/client can repeat the game without disconnecting
2. user can choose difficulty based on the generated random number to guess

- a. easy (1-50)
- b. medium (1-100)
- c.hard (1-500)
  
1. the game implements a scoring mechanism based on the number of tries the user guesses the number to guess (less tries the better), and provide a leaderboard containing the name of the user and her/his score which is displayed after the user/client disconnects from the server.
   
2. persistence - the server should save the user's name, his/her score, and the last chosen difficulty (should default to easy) into a file and this file will be loaded/updated during leaderboard display and when the user set's the difficulty.


### Deliverables:

1. Video explainer (MP4 format only), please explain the code thoroughly and be technical as possible, it will be obvious to me if you do not know what you are talking about. your video should contain the demo of the features you've added (first part), then the explanation of the code of those added features (second part)

2. github repository of the code (i'll be looking at the commit history from start to finish), provide a README.md for installation procedures or any other dependency information.

### Submission:
answer the provided Google form, the form will require you to provide the video link (must be public), and the github repository link of your code. submit on/before the given deadline
